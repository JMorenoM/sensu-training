00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.760
Let's talk about the differences between the open source version of Sensu and the Enterprise version.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.040
First though, full disclosure: I am NOT an employee of Heavy Water Industries.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.620
I'm just a normal engineer.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.040
I am responsible for the systems that I build.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.400
I am on call for them,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.660
and I have to make that decision of whether we should build versus buy

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.720
or whether we should pay someone to help us build something

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.120
or devote a team of engineers to help us integrate something.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.940
To be honest I've never used the Enterprise version of Sensu.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.220
I've only used the open-sourced version.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.560
But, this is an introductory course, and it's worth talking about, the differences here.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.559
Not everyone has a crack team of engineers to take Sensu and integrate it tightly

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.059
with their existing infrastructure.
Either way you should make an informed

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.270
decision about whether you're going to
use the open source version or the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.860
Enterprise version. So let's talk about the
differences. The main difference between

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.470
the open source version and the
Enterprise version, is the support. When

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.979
you pay for a subscription to the
Enterprise version of Sensu, you are

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.439
entitled to get somebody on the phone to
help you figure out why it may not be

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.049
working. If you're using the open source version, 
you only have the type of community

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.439
support that comes with most open source projects. That's like the mailing list and

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.670
IRC and that kind of thing. Of course there are other avenues of training,  this one example,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.220
but for the most part you're gonna be on
your own for integrating Sensu at

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.200
your organization. If you pay for the
Enterprise version, not only will you get a few

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.170
niceties, and nice features, you also get
the ability to depend on a company to be

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.880
there, when you have questions, and when you need someone to help you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.770
troubleshoot and debug why the product is not working. So, keep this in mind when you're making

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.920
this decision of whether to use the
open-source, versus the Enterprise version.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.319
A lot of the other technical differences
have to do with how well-tightly-

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.670
integrated Sensu is with a lot of
"turn-key" style plugins. Let's talk about

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.550
more specific technical differences.
Remember this is not a sales pitch, but any

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.010
engineer building this type of system
should at least be informed about the differences

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.580
you can make the best decision for your
situation.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.380
Let's talk about each piece. This "contact routing" thing: the Enterprise version of Sensu comes with a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.650
bunch of configured handlers, that will
cover ninety percent of what you might

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.470
want Sensu to do with and alert. So this
contact routing feature allows you to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.810
specify the recipient of an alert, on a per-check basis. It's not that you can't do this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.319
with the open source version, it's just a
little more tricky. This built-in

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.660
third-party integrations thing means
that the Enterprise version comes with

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.900
these handlers I just talked about. They're
versions of the open-source handlers

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.170
that are on GitHub, but they're just
more tightly integrated with the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.859
product, so they'll come pre-installed. The
role-based access control and LDAP,

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.609
these are things that integrate with the
Sensu dashboard, the open source

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.200
version of the Sensu dashboard: Uchiwa, doesn't really have any concept of principle of least

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.850
privilege, or access controls or anything like that. It's kind of left as

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.549
an exercise to the reader. Certainly
your totally free to use an existing web

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.799
server in front of Uchiwa to handle
the type of authentication you might

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.840
need. But if you choose to use the
Enterprise version of Sensu, you'll get

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.530
integrated LDAP, and GitHub, and other
types of access control, built into the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.440
dashboard. The support and training is
probably the biggest feature of the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.530
Enterprise version. The training
is cool of course, but the support is what

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.030
you're really paying for here. The Sensu model is very similar to many other

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.109
open source projects, where the
Enterprise version comes with, you know,

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.789
a phone number you can call it get someone on the horn when need help. Again, the differences between

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.949
the open source and the Enterprise
versions of Sensu, pretty much come

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:35.900
down to: how tightly integrated a product
is with the rest of the ecosystem and

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.780
support. So if you're in a situation where
those things are important to you, it may

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.210
very well be worth the money to pay for
the Enterprise version. On the other hand

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.770
if you're used to taking an open source
product integrating with your infrastructure

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.909
already, and you don't mind

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.669
investing the time to integrate
that product with your stuff, and you're

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.229
not afraid to be on the hook for a
system when it doesn't go right,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.889
the open source version might be okay
for you. It just depends on your scale, your

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.370
particular work environment, and the
business needs that you have to meet. That's about all I

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.669
have to say about this. Again, I don't
wanna make this sound like a sales pitch

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.029
for one way or the other. But again, as an
engineer, I think that we all need to be

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.009
at least aware of these differences, and we need to be making informed decisions about

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.060
these type of tradeoffs. That's about all I
have to say about that.
