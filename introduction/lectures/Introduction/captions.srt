Hi.  Welcome to Sensu: An introduction.
My name is Kyle.  I'm an engineer.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,030
I build systems for a living.  I run Sensu in production.  I get paged for it; I get paged for

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,480
all the systems I build.  I care about them
and I want to build systems that I can

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,300
be proud of.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,279
I'm proud of the Sensu infrastructure I've built. I'd like to share that with you.  Throughout

6
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,580
this course I'll be teaching mostly the
open source version of Sensu,

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,960
although I will cover the differences
between the open source enterprise

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,950
version, if you're interested in that.  I hope
that you are also an engineer who wants

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,829
to build good systems and whether you're
installing a monitoring system from scratch

10
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,800
where you currently don't have a monitoring system or if you're replacing an

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,860
existing centralized monitoring with a modern one like
Sensu, both of these use cases are

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:04,650
covered in this introductory course.  I also hope
that you'll share my enthusiasm

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,950
about Sensu's architecture and
flexibility.

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,260
These to me are the two key points that make
Sensu different compared to all the

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,210
other monitoring systems out there.  So sit
back, take some notes, get a server

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,470
running and walk with me through
installing and configuring Sensu for

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,220
the first time.  I hope you enjoy it!
