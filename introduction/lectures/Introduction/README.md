### Intro

Welcome to Sensu: an Introduction. Throughout this course I will be teaching
you the basics of Sensu and how it works. I won't make any assumptions that you
know anything about Sensu, as it is an introductory course. I will, however,
assume that you do know a bit about systems in general, and some monitoring
theory. If you are interested in monitoring systems, and you have heard of
Sensu, then it's likely you know a bit about your systems already and you care
enough to monitor them.

Unless otherwise specified, I'm going to focus only on the Open Source version
of Sensu, and not the Enterprise version. (but I will mention the differences
if they come up)
