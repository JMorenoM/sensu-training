00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well thank you for following through
with me on the Introductory Course on Sensu

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.740
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.800
I also hope you have a new-found appreciation for Sensu,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.400
and maybe a little bit of enthusiasm for

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.780
what makes Sensu unique, flexible and something to be proud of if you've built it.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.560
Long-term, I think that Sensu and modular frameworks like this are the future

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.180
of how we will monitor dynamic systems

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.260
and I think Sensu's architecture and fundamental design decisions are good ones.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.100
Don't forget that you can review any past
lecture if you feel fuzzy on any particular subject.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600
And also don't forget that every lecture
has show notes

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.340
with the exact commands I ran during that lecture.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600
Also, every lecture has extra materials for more reading

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.340
and further documentation on the
subject that we covered.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.360
If you can get over that initial hump of understanding and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.360
getting your head around the Sensu architecture and components,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.880
I think you'll find that it's very powerful for building systems that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.560
nobody really thought you could build before you had a monitoring system this flexible.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.460
I hope that this course helps you get over that hump

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.560
And stay tuned for more courses on Sensu that I'll teach

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.880
covering more intermediate and advanced subjects.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.700
Things like taking Sensu to a "production level",

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.260
making its scalable and secure

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.660
and also taking advantage of that flexibility that we only just scratched the surface on.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.560
Well that about covers it for their introductory course.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.920
Again I hope you enjoyed it and I hope
this has made you a better engineer

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.600
giving you a tool in your toolbox to
build things that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
are really powerful and really something to be proud of.
