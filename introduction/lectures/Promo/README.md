Hi! My name is Kyle and I would like to be your guide to understanding Sensu.

I would like to share some of my Sensu knowledge with you, and walk you
through, step by step, the process of getting Sensu up and running for the
first time.

Should you take this course? Yes!

If you are here listening to me now, then you have probably heard of Sensu.

And if you have heard of Sensu, you owe it to yourself to see why it is a thing,
and why people have rejected monolithic centralized monitoring systems in favor
of it. There is a reason people love Sensu, and its because for the first time
they get to have control over how their monitoring works, and they finally get
the flexibility to do things they could never do with, you know, Nagios or
whatever. This is what I want to share with you.

At the very least you owe it to yourself to see the Second lecture called
"Why Should I Care About Sensu?", this is the lecture after I explain how
Sensu works in the first place, and then I talk about what makes Sensu special,
and how it empowers engineers like you to build and monitor things in ways that really
wern't possible before.

### What we'll cover

* We'll setup Sensu *from scratch* so you can see all the pieces and how they
  interact.
* I'll explain the architcture and information flow, from when a check gets run, to how it gets
  processed, to how sending an email alert you.
* We'll talk about the Dashboard, how to interact with it, and then where to go
  from there.

And guess what, experiencing a system for the first time is all about making mistakes and learning from them. In these
courses I'm not going to get all my commands right the first time, I'm actually
going to purposly make common mistakes, ask some questions to myself about what
might possibly be wrong, and do my own troubleshooting right in front of you.
That way you will know what it looks like when you've got it right, when you've
got it wrong, and hopefully you'll have a few hints on what to do about it when you encounter similar issues. To
me that is the real value of this course.

Sometimes you can learn more by watching over someones sholder in just a few minutes what would take hours of trying to read docs and understand things that way.

### Conclusion

So if you are looking to step up your monitoring game with Sensu,
enroll today and learn about together with me :)
