Hi.  My name is Kyle and I'm a systems
engineer and I run Sensu in production at

1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,639
scale.  At the end of course you'll have a
fully working Sensu setup.  It'll be

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,120
actually checking things and actually
sending you emails when things are broken.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,230
We'll also cover how to use the dashboard
and how to take advantage of the Sensu

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,980
community plug-ins; a huge repo of open
source plugins that's ready to be

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,380
integrated with Sensu with a single
command.  And guess what?

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,369
Learning a new system is all about
making mistakes.  In this course I'm

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,120
actually gonna purposely make mistakes,

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
go through the act of actually
troubleshooting them and then fix them right

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,410
in front of you.  That way you know what
it looks like when things are broken and

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,550
what it looks like when they're
fixed.  This course is specifically

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,879
designed for curious DevOps-y style
engineers who are looking to better

12
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,850
their craft.  So enroll today and learn
about what makes Sensu special with

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,010
me.
