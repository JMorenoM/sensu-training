00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,600
Welcome to the lecture on installing a Sensu dashboard.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,920
Would you believe that out of the box Sensu doesn't come with a dashboard?

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,520
Surprised?

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,100
You shouldn't be.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,220
Remember Sensu's all about flexibility and modularized components that to do one thing well.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,760
It's refreshing to me that Sensu doesn't provide a dashboard

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,200
because that means that it's API is well formed

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,920
and ready to integrate with any kind of external component that you might need

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,340
including a dashboard or a CLI or something custom.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:43,040
in other words Sensu's decoupling philosophy means that you can use any kind of external component

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,180
including something in-house and it will work.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
If you've got something fancy you want to integrate Sensu with, go for it.

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,600
The Sensu API is well constructed and easy to integrate with.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,980
For most people, using the standard, open source Uchiwa dashboard works well for them.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
So that's what we'll do in this lecture.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
The official Sensu documentation
references two different dashboards:

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,840
Uchiwa, which is the open sourced version

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,460
and then there's Sensu Enterprise Dashboard, that's the proprietary Version.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,820
Being an introductory course we're gonna stick with the open source one.

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,420
The enterprise one has more
advanced features

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,580
for things like LDAP and fancy fine grained access controls,

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,180
but we won't need these for this introductory video.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,740
If you are interested in the enterprise dashboard there is a later lecture

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,880
that will cover all the differences between the enterprise and open-source offerings.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,740
Let's go ahead and install Uchiwa.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,500
Uchiwa is available from the existing Sensu repositories you've already enabled.

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,900
So it's very easy to install.

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,440
Let's take a look at the actual package.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,660
It's got some files, but take a look you can see the source code, it is in Go.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,100
The frontend is in javascript,

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,580
and then there's the binary.

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,560
Let's look at the configuration file that it provided for us.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,540
As you can see it's hinting here that Uchiwa is designed to be multi-site aware.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,880
You could declare multiple sites and Uchiwa will provide that kind of

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,700
single pane of glass to show you all of them together.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,260
This is pretty handy as you scale out Sensu to monitor multiple data centers or multiple regions.

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,380
It's pretty handy.

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,880
For this introductory course we only have one site just localhost so we don't need this second one.

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
This entry here represents the actually API endpoint.

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,440
For us this is the localhost.

41
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,680
And "site1" is fine, I'm just gonna call it also localhost.

42
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,640
you should take note here that the default binding is on all IPs, on port 3000.

43
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,300
And if it wasn't obvious, it is HTTP.

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,100
Ok, let's go ahead and start Uchiwa.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,580
You saw that it listens on port 3000 so let's see if we can load it in our web browser.

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,660
It's not working.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Well, let's do some troubleshooting.

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,420
Is Uchiwa running?

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,560
It isn't.

50
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,460
Let's look at the logs

51
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,760
The log for Uchiwa is in /var/log/

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,540
There's an "uchiwa.er" and a "uchiwa.log".

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,980
Looks like there's some contents of "uchiwa.log" so let's look at that.

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
JSON output again

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,660
Here's the smoking gun:

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,940
"couldn't read uchiwa.json decoding the file."

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,040
remember when I said that JSON is for machines and humans aren't very good at

58
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,260
editing them?  Well, it's true.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,740
Here's a good opportunity to use that "jq" command again: "jq . uchiwa.json"

60
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Here it gives a closer error here is line 9, column 3. So let's take a look at that...

61
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,680
Although it's pretty subtle the
error here is that I have a trailing comma.

62
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,840
And now it prints out ok. Let's try to start it again.

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,960
Let's just check that it is actually running.

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
It is.

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,220
And we're back up.

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,240
Let's take a look at our API endpoints here.

67
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,560
We have one endpoint, in Uchiwa the front end is described as data centers.

68
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,100
It is connected.

69
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,060
We have one client, "mycoolhost" from when we originally set up the client.

70
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,840
And we have a check, that memory check that we set up originally.

71
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,240
In the next lecture we'll cover the ins and outs of Uchiwa in more depth,

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,700
but for now this is the basic installation and troubleshooting of Uchiwa.
