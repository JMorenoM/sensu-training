00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
Hi! Welcome to the screencast on installing Redis. If you remember from our

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.900
architecture diagram, Redis is where Sensu stores its state. While it may

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.580
seem like an extra component at first, to
tack on, it is essential to the ability

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.210
for Sensu to scale, because with Redis, none of the Sensu

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.060
servers need to store their state with
them, and that means that they are stateless

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.050
and you can have as many as you want.
We'll talk about that in more advanced courses

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.230
but for now we're just install a basic
Redis instance. Again like before we're going to use

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.969
the official documentation, do it step by
step, and we're also going to be using

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.929
our vagrant box, that we used last time...

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.680
For this we're going to be installing just the stock version of the Redis server that comes with Ubuntu trusty.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.520
Most of the time you'll be able to get away with the version of Redis that comes with your distribution.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Now we'll start it up...

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.960
Apparently it was already running.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.380
Now that may be, a very simple installation of Redis, and it is,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.860
because it's a very easy storage machine to get going, but let's go a little further, to see

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.619
if it's working.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.420
The Sensu docs recommend a "redis-cli ping", so let's check that out...

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.760
Redis is running. You should get to know at least where the logs are in case you need to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.530
troubleshoot, it's in the standard
location you might expect:"/var/log/redis/"

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.759
Not much going on. But, if you had
issues with connecting to it or if it couldn't start,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.069
here's where you might go to look to see
what might be going wrong. Of course it is

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.369
good to know with every component, what port it listens on and where, and what it binds to.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.700
You can see that stock installation, we're
binding to localhost:6379. So if you're

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.520
working firewalls or just
troubleshooting, it's good to know.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.230
That's about it for Redis. Again it's a very
simple storage-machine that we will use,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.190
that Sensu-server will use to store its
state. Now that it's running, our next steps,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.510
our next pieces will be able to take advantage of it.
