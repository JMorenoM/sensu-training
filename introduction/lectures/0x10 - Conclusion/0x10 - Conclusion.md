== Conclusion

Sensu is a flexible monitoring framework. It has new concepts to learn, and new pieces to learn to setup and configure.

Is it worth it? In my experience the answer is absolutely yes.

Everything about Sensu is Modern, and it is refreshing. Each piece does one thing well, it has a real test suite, it is designed to be used with real Configuration Management, its good stuff.

If you can get over the initial hump of learning a new system, I promise that these pros outweigh the cons, and the differences will pay you back dividends as you attempt to scale or build anything non-trivial.

I hope this course helps you get over *that hump*. Don't forget you are absolutely free to review previous lectures in case you want to refresh your knowledge on the data flow or architecture.
