Hi! My name is Kyle and I know a thing or two about Sensu.

I would like to share with you some of that knowledge with you, and walk you
through, step by step, the process of getting Sensu up and running for the
first time.

Should you take this course? Yes!

If you have heard of Sensu, you owe it to yourself to see why it is a thing,
and why people have rejected monolithic centralized monitoring systems in favor
of it. There is a reason people love Sensu, and its because for the first time
they get to have control over how their monitoring works, and they finally get
the flexibility to do things they could never do with, you know, Nagios or
whatever. And I want to share this with you!

=== What we'll cover

* We'll setup Sensu *from scratch* so you can see all the pieces and how they
  interact.
* I'll explain the whole flow, from when a check gets run, to how it gets
  processed, to how sending an email alert you.
* We'll talk about the Dashboard, how to interact with it, and then where to go
  from there.

=== Conclusion

So if you are looking to step up your monitoring game with Sensu, this is a
great course to enroll in to get started.
