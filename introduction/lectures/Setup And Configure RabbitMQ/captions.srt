00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi and welcome to the screencast on installing and configuring RabbitMQ.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,280
If you remember from our architecture diagram RabbitMQ is the central message bus

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,380
between the Sensu server and the Sensu Client.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,880
So we have to get it setup first before we can really do much of anything in Sensu.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,480
So that's what we'll do.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,020
I'm mostly going to be following the guidelines of the official Sensu documentation.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm doing this because this is an introductory course, so it's likely you'll have kind of a stock setup

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
with no previous installation.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm going to be following the guidelines kind of verbatim,

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,200
so let's do it.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,520
First we'll start by installing Erlang.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,580
if you didn't know RabbitMQ is written in Erlang so it requires the Erlang virtual machine.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,840
We're going to be installing from the official sources.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,140
We'll speed pass the installation here

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,460
You may not technically need the most latest and greatest version of Erlang and RabbitMQ

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
but it's recommended.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,880
There's always the trade-off of course between using the latest versions from

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,060
external sources versus the stable
versions from the distro but

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
they may be outdated.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,460
The official docs do recommend using the latest versions so that's what we do here in this video.

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,080
And now that we have Erlang installed, we'll install RabbitMQ.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,040
Again we're using the official upstream repositories.

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,960
To get the latest version.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,780
Of course if you already have a RabbitMQ installation

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,660
you're absolutely free to use it.

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,210
Sensu doesn't really mind where it gets
RabbitMQ as long as it's available.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,180
Of course for this introduction video we're going to be just using our local server to host RabbitMQ,

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,860
but it could very easily be a remote
installation or an existing RabbitMQ cluster.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,220
Again this is one of the nice things
about Sensu is because it's modular

30
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,600
if you need to scale out your RabbitMQ separately from your Sensu cluster you can.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,060
And of course you can reuse RabbitMQ
for your own purposes as well.

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,500
Per the docs, we'll make it start on default and we'll start it up.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,120
RabbitMQ is kind of like Apache in the sense that is has vhosts

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,840
that allow you to segregate different queues and different

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,860
exchanges to different users.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,000
So per the official documentation we are going to make a Sensu RabbitMQ vhost.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,000
And we'll give that Sensu user permissions

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,500
We'll make it a Sensu user and give it permissions user and get permissions to that vhost.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,380
That's all there is for the official documentation on RabbitMQ.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,240
I'd like to give you a little bit more information about

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
RabbitMQ in case you've never run it before.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,020
RabbitMQ is it's own things own thing, it's got it's own docs, it's own

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,040
scaling properties, it's own failure modes,

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,060
but you should at least be aware of where the logs are.

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,720
The logs are in the place you'd expect them to be:

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,760
/var/log/rabbitmq/

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,020
It's got a couple different logs for different of things but the main log is going to be this one here.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,880
Not much to report yet, but you'll see more when we start up Sensu and it starts communicating.

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,120
Very common errors occur when there's a
mismatch between the Sensu configuration

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,720
for RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ's
configuration.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,100
For example: usernames and password and vhosts and that kind of thing.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,100
RabbitMQ also has a web interface
which is nice to have in some situations.

53
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,120
It's good to have some visualization
into what's going on behind the scenes

54
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,040
there's a little more work to enable it,

55
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,260
but you can enable the RabbitMQ management plugin.

56
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,380
Now because I'm using your Vagrant I have to make

57
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,500
a separate SSH tunnel to get localhost access because

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,040
by default it's only available using the guest user with localhost

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,540
and then you can just open up localhost:15672

60
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,040
the management port in your web broser and then you can use the guest account.

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,360
username is guest

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,220
password is guest

63
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,560
And you can see that there's not much going on again, there's

64
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,900
just installed, so nothings actually happen here

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,080
but it's good to know that this exists so you can see what's going on

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,800
That's about it for RabbitMQ. Again
there's not much going on more not so it's not much to see

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,640
but once we install Sensu you'll see messages flowing in here.

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,260
I have additional information on the lecture
notes regarding the official

69
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,110
documentation and the steps and commands I ran in this.

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,530
Again they mostly mirror from what the official Sensu documentation has

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:09:26,020
but that's about it for RabbitMQ.
