# Sensu Training

## Introduction

The introduction course is geared towards first-time users.
It also works well for people who have used a bit of Sensu before, but
don't know really how it works under the hood.

Stuff:

* In-depth architectural overview
* Step-by-step howto instructions on getting Sensu up and running
* Leverage your existing Nagios plugins written in C, Python, or Bash
* Take advantage of the plethora of Open Source Sensu plugins in Ruby!
* Learn about RabbitMQ, Redis, Ruby Gems, Sensu's API, and more
* Use **Uchiwa**, the awesome open source Dashboard for Sensu
* Setup the foundation to build on more intermediate and advanced Sensu topics
