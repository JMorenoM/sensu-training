  **Sensu** is a powerful Next-Generation monitoring framework.

  More than just a beginner Sensu user? Ready to learn more?

  This **intermediate** course will teach you the things you
  need to setup Sensu in ***Production***.

  Production to me means that it is:

  * Monitored (Yes, we monitor the monitors)
  * Sustainably deployed (with configuration management)
  * Has room to grow (new handlers, new checks, etc)
