  **Sensu** is a powerful Next-Generation monitoring framework that is quickly
  replacing traditional monitoring systems like Zabbix, Icinga, and Nagios.

  More than just a beginner Sensu user? Ready to learn more?

  This **intermediate** course will teach you the things you
  need to setup Sensu in ***Production***.

  **Contents**

  * Realtime whiteboard interaction - learn like you would if I was right in front of you
  * In-depth architecture overview and recap
  * Deploy and configure Sensu with Configuration Management - I fully cover Chef / Puppet / Ansible / Salt
  * Tune and Filter noisy alerts, keep your pager under control
  * Write your own Sensu Check and Handlers - Live code demonstration
  * Security walkthrough - deploying SSL, hardening API endpoints
  * Advanced Sensu-cli usage and examples
  * Bonus: Dynamically monitoring infrastructure by pushing your own custom events
  * Extensive show-notes, vagrant images, and source code is open-source and on Github

  When you are finished with the course, you will be ready to deploy a
  performant, secure, and tuned Sensu installation for your organization.

  **Let Me Make The Mistakes For You**

  It's one thing to read docs and get perfect copy-paste command line examples
  that work. It is another thing to be in real life watching a real engineer
  fight a live system and try to get it working! I purposely make mistakes
  just to demonstrate what happens when things go wrong. That gives me an
  excuse to troubleshoot the problem and then solve it. Then, when you encounter
  that same mistake in your infrastructure, you will know exactly what to do!

  **For Dev and Ops Alike**

  Sysadmins, Devops Practitioners, Infrastructure engineers, SREs, and simply
  curious software engineers should take this course to better their craft and
  learn more about what makes Sensu special. It is **not** your
  grandfather's monitoring system. It is a modern, scalable, flexible
  monitoring system with a great API to integrate with your infrastructure.

  This course is a **must** for engineers who are currently, or considering
  deploying Sensu intro production. Increasing the scope of your DevOps
  toolbox, enroll today and check it out!
