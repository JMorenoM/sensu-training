== Intermediate Promo

Hi. My name is Kyle and I'm a systems engineer. I've used Sensu in production, at scale, for a while now, and I've picked up a thing or two.

If you haven't enrolled in my Introduction course, I encourage you to do so. It will lay the groundwork for understanding how Sensu works. For this course, I'm going to assume you know the basics, and we are going to be focusing on "Running in Production". What does that mean? It means we'll talk about:

=== Configuration Management

Config management is near and dear to my heart. It is the key to getting reproducable configuration for any system, and Sensu is no different. I'll cover all the popular configuration management systems.

=== Utilizing third-party Check plugins and Handlers

External check plugins and handlers provide a lot of value to Sensu, but they don't come installed out of the box. I'll show you how to take advantage of these, and even write your own.

=== More advanced event routing

If you are going to run Sensu in production, it means you need real actionable alerts. For example sending your important alerts to Pagerduty and sending other things to email, or setting up aggregation checks across a fleet of webservers. I'll cover this sort of event routing.

=== Security

Having a production Sensu environment implies that it is secure. So I'll cover adding SSL to the transport and point out other places to harden Sensu or other common security gotchas you might encounter building out your Sensu infrastructure.
