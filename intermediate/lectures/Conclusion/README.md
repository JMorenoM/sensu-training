# Conclusion

Thank you for taking my intermediate Sensu course. I hope you learned a lot!

I hope you watched at least one of the lectures on configuration management. I
think that configuration management is really great, and Sensu works really
well with a configuration management too, whether that would be Puppet, Chef,
Ansible or Salt.

I hope you understand Sensu's internals a little better, and are able to deploy
Sensu to production, and fully understand any security implications that might
come with it.

I also hope that you fully understand now the power of the Sensu embedded ruby.
It really is a simplifying tool that comes with Sensu, that helps you deploy
checks and handlers in a consistent way. And of course it makes it so that all
of those community plugins and handlers are installable with a single command.

Again, thank you for taking my course. Watch your inbox for announcements on
this course or future course I might publish. And of course, as a customer, you
are entitled to feedback. Let me know if there is room to improve this course
or if there is a topic I didn't cover well enough, that you are still kinda
fuzzy on. I'm constantly trying to improve my courses for you.

That is it, again, thank you.
